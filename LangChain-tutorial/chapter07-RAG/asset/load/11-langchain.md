LangGraph is an extension of LangChain aimed at building robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

LangGraph documentation is currently hosted on a separate site. You can peruse [LangGraph how-to guides here](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/).

## [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/)[](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#langsmith)

LangSmith allows you to closely trace, monitor and evaluate your LLM application. It seamlessly integrates with LangChain and LangGraph, and you can use it to inspect and debug individual steps of your chains and agents as you build.

LangSmith documentation is hosted on a separate site. You can peruse [LangSmith how-to guides here](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/), but we'll highlight a few sections that are particularly relevant to LangChain below:

### Evaluation[](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#evaluation)



Evaluating performance is a vital part of building LLM-powered applications. LangSmith helps with every step of the process from creating a dataset to defining metrics to running evaluators.
